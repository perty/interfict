Nayoko made a cough as quietly as she could, not to startle the small man. Right after she coughed she the man said, “I know you’re there, I’ve seen you before.” He started to remove twigs and branches with his axe without waiting for a response.

Before he could say anything more Nayoko snuck in her response “Your house, what do you mean, _your house_” 

“My house, you live in my house” the small man seemed certain. “I have built that house with my own hands”. Nayoko thought about the preposterous sight of this small man building a wooden house of the size she lived in.

Nayko looked at the man then she said
