Nayoko continued to walk for a few minutes and then, suddenly, she stopped. An idea had popped into her mind. 

She started to whistle. At first nothing happened but then a moment later she saw a glimmering light a few metres in front of her.

She continued to whistle, and the glimmering light grew stronger.

As she intensified the whistling even more the light grew brighter. She continued and the light continued to intensify. 

When the light was so bright that Nayoko could not look at it, she stopped. 

“Why did you stop?” said a voice. 

Nayoko was so surprised she could not speak.

“Please go on, that was such a beautiful song, it reminded me of a friend I used to have.”

The light faded and the green and black butterfly that Nayko had seen earlier appeared from the middle of the light.

What does Nayoko say?

You can talk!
Why did you disappear?
