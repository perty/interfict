Once upon a time there was a girl named Nayoko who lived in a small house at the edge of a long beach. 

Nayoko had fair white skin and long dark hair that almost reached her feet. When the little girl tilted her head backwards, 
which she loved doing, the hair did reach her ankles.

One morning when Nayoko was out for a walk she caught upon the most beautiful butterfly she had ever seen. 

The butterfly had green wings with black rims and a peculiar shimmer of light surrounding its body.

Nayoko started to follow the butterfly and before she knew it she found herself standing on the beach.

She looked at the butterfly in front of here and suddenly a strong wind caught the beautiful greenwinged insect, and carried it away.

Nayoko became puzzled and thought to herself, "What should I do?"

1. Go back to the house
2. Look around and try to find the butterfly
