Nayoko sat down as silently and quickly as she could. Without letting her eyes off the small man. For five minutes she sat crouching watching the man trying to axe down the small tree. 

The man stopped his chopping. He leaned the axe on his right leg and put his left hand in his breast pocket.

Nayoko saw the man draw out the smallest and cutest handkerchief she had ever seen. Then the man started to wipe his forehead with it. She heard a faint sigh and then the man returned the handkerchief to his pocket and started chomping at the tree.

The work looked hard and after a few more minutes the man stopped. He straightened himself up and Nayoko hoped he would draw out the handkerchief again. But this time the man gave the tree a long hard look instead. He eyed the tree, and then he gave the tree a thick whack with the back of his axe.

Nothing happened. 

Nayko looked at the man, then at the tree, then back at the man. A few seconds later the tree fell to the ground.

What does Nayoko do?

1. Say something
2. Keep hiding
