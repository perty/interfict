“I would love to help you” said Nayoko, “What kind of help do you need?” 

The butterfly said it was hard to leave the beach because of the strong wind. Maybe Nayko could be a shield against the wind. “I can sit on your shoulder and then you can carry me over the dune of sand over there …” The butterfly continued “... when we reach shelter behind the dune, the wind cannot reach me and I will help you back home.

Naoyko nodded and kept nodding as the butterfly landed on her left shoulder.

The little girl started to walk towards the sand dune.

The wind had become a bit more intense now. Nayoko became more determined in her walking and as soon as she reached the dune she began to climb it. A gust of wind tried to grab the butterfly as they reached the peak of the dune. The girl just tilted her head and let her long hair become a soft wall.

“Thank you” said the butterfly. 

And before she knew it Naoyko found herself in front of her house again.

“Wait …” said Nayoko. 

“Wait for what?” said her father. Nayoko spun around.

1. Run to father
2. Say nothing
