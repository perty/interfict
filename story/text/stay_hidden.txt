“I see you!” said the small man. “I may be old, but my eyes have not failed me yet”.

Taken by surprise Nayoko stumbled upon her words but eventually managed to say “Who … what … who are you?”

The man responded. “I am Saki, the builder of houses …” he waited but a second then continued “I have built over a hundred houses. Much like yours.”. He paused briefly “... I have built your house.”

Nayoko looked as doubtful as ever when she eyed the man.

He was very well dressed. He had a white shirt, dark trousers with suspenders and a narrow brimmed hat. 

She rose and started to walk towards the small man. After e few meters she stopped hesitantly. 

"Come closer, so you can see how I do it ..."

1. Closer
2. Stay
