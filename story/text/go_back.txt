Nayoko heard her mothers voice in her head. “Easy come, easy go!” 

She kicked her foot in the sand and lowered her head. “Stupid butterfly,” she said in a low voice, then started walking back towards her house.

Halfway to the house she heard a faint knocking sound. Once again Nayokos was distracted and instead of walking back to the house she now steered towards the knocking. The sound grew more and more intense. The sound seemed to come from the woods near the beach. She decided to follow the sound and entered the woods.

“I wonder what’s making that sound …” thought Nayko. 

She looked around and walked deeper into the woods. Suddenly she saw something she had never seen before. She saw a very short man chopping down a small three with a tiny axe. 

She had not seen such a small man before. He was but two feet tall and in his miniscule hands he held an axe no longer than a needle.
