“My name is Falifa”. The voice of the butterfly was so tender. It almost felt like a caress. “I am over a hundred years old but I have never seen you before.”

The little girl did not know how to respond, so she stood there in silence.

Falifa the butterfly looked at Nayoko with worry. 

“I was concerned that the Mean Wind was going to take me out to sea again”. The butterfly continued.

“Maybe you can help me?”

Nayoko finally found her words again and responded.

1. I would love to help
2. You need to manage your own problems
