Nayoko felt a slap on her face so hard her ears started ringing. What had just happened. She was standing in front of her house again. Two seconds ago she was standing at the beach conversing with a talking butterfly. Now she was standing at her house again. With her ears ringing.

She heard a sound at the door.

The door opened and her father looked out. He seemed puzzled, then he said. “Where have you been all day, we have been looking for you …”

Say nothing
Run to father
