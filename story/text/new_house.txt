A sound approached Nayoko. It was as if a thunderstorm came from the feet of the little well dressed man. 

It grew stronger and stronger and then, as Nayoko thought her whole being would be crushed by the sound, the house in front of her started to grow.

The house grew, the small bushes surrounding the house grew and even the ground that the house stood on expanded. It took no more than seconds before the house was as big as her own. It even looked like her house.

Nayoko could not believe what she had just seen. She shut her eyes and opened them again. She tried to blink a few times but the house was still there. She turned to where Saki had stood moments earlier. 

He was no longer there. 

Surprised by the turn of events, Nayokos head started spinning. She sat herself down.

As she sat there a strange feeling crept up opon Nayko. There was someone inside. She turned her head and saw the door open.

Her mother appeared at the door. “Where have you been? We have been looking for you all morning ...”.

1. Say nothing
2. Run to mother
