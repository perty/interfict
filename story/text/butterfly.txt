Determined to find the beautiful butterfly, Nayoko started to walk along the beach. 

She looked to the sky, she looked down on the sand, she looked to the left and to the right. Nowhere was the butterfly.

Farther and farther away from her house she went, but the beautiful green butterfly could not be found. "I might as well walk to the end of the beach" she thought to herself. 

Without thinking further she continued to walk along the beach.

"I will find the butterfly, even if it means walking to the end of the world ..."

Nayoko had in fact never been this far from her house. At least not on her own. 

She was not even allowed to be at the beach by herself. “But the butterfly is so beautiful, my parents will understand”. 

She reasoned with herself as she went onwards. "Maybe I Should turn back?"

What does she do?

1. Goes on even further
2. Returns home
